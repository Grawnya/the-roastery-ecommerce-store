# The Roastery E-Commerce Store

## Introduction

Welcome to the coding repository dedicated to the "The Roastery"'s Ecommerce Store; A website which not only provides details about a made up coffee ecommerce website, but also allows users to buy coffee from the website.

The project is very relevant as online shopping is becoming increasingly popular, therefore, people are keen to buy everything they used aily including the coffee for their coffee machines or french presses. The flexibility of the website ensures that its design can be utilised for any ecommerce store that requires the user to purchase the products with a card in advance of receiving them.
